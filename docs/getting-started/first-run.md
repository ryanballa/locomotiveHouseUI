# First Run

Get the application running for the first time.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you've completed:
1. ‚úÖ [Installation](./installation.md) - Dependencies installed
2. ‚úÖ [Environment Setup](./environment.md) - Environment variables configured

## Starting the Development Server

### 1. Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see output similar to:
```
> locomotive-house-client@1.0.0 dev
> next dev

  ‚ñ≤ Next.js 15.x.x
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Environments: .env.local

  ‚úì Ready in 1.5s
```

### 2. Open in Browser

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

You should see:
- The Locomotive House application loaded
- Navigation bar with "Sign In" button
- Application content

## Signing In

### 1. Click "Sign In"
In the top-right corner of the navbar, click the "Sign In" button.

### 2. Create an Account or Sign In
A modal will appear with Clerk's authentication interface:
- **New User**: Click "Create account" and fill in the form
- **Existing User**: Enter your credentials and click "Sign in"

### 3. Verify Sign-In
After signing in, you should see:
- Your user profile picture or initial in the top-right corner
- The navbar now shows additional menu items (Appointments, Addresses)
- A modal or redirect to the home page

## Testing Core Features

### View Appointments
1. Click "Appointments" in the navbar
2. You should see a list of appointments (may be empty initially)
3. A dropdown menu should appear with:
   - View Appointments
   - Create Appointment

### Create an Appointment
1. In the Appointments dropdown, click "Create Appointment"
2. Select a date and time
3. Set the duration
4. Click "Create Appointment"

You should see:
- A success message or the appointment appearing in the list
- No console errors

### View Addresses
1. Click "Addresses" in the navbar
2. You should see the address management interface
3. If you see "Club Assignment Required", this is expected if your club isn't set up

## Verifying Everything Works

Check the browser console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I) for:
- ‚úÖ No red errors
- ‚úÖ API calls completing successfully (Network tab)
- ‚úÖ Authentication working (Clerk user visible)

Check the terminal for:
- ‚úÖ Next.js dev server running without errors
- ‚úÖ API requests being logged

## Troubleshooting First Run

### "Club Assignment Required" message
This is expected if:
- You just created a new account
- Your user hasn't been assigned to a club yet

**Solution**:
- Use admin features to assign yourself to a club
- Or check with your administrator

### Sign-in button does nothing
- **Check**: Are your Clerk keys correct in `.env.local`?
- **Check**: Did you restart the dev server after adding environment variables?
- **Fix**: Restart with `Ctrl+C` and `npm run dev`

### "Cannot find API" error
- **Check**: Is your API running separately?
- **Check**: Is `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` correct in `.env.local`?
- **Check**: Are there CORS errors in the console?

### Styles look broken (no Tailwind CSS)
- **Check**: Are there CSS load errors in the console?
- **Fix**: Try clearing the Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next && npm run dev`
